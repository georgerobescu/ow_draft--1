# ow—draft #1, notes

*Some notes and an attempt to outline the **draft #1** of the project*

* git
* readme.md
* self-realisation
* self-discipline
* subjectivisation
* ethics
* collectivity
* distribution

The first draft of the project consists in the writing of a `readme.md` file, a very common piece of information almost always present inside the folder repository of a code-based project.

`git` is a system that helps to keep track of every change made inside a selected folder: in this way a programmer can have a more granular control of what has been implemented, patched, deleted and so on, to the point of spotting differences at the level of single characters.

This mechanism transforms the person using it in a sort of log-keeper, putting her/him in a position in which for the benefit of future reviews, every actions she/he makes is traced.

Hence, the `readme.md` file acts as the welcome door to someone’s project. In it, it is usually delineated the objectives of the repository, how it has been implemented (citing other projects which have been made use of), and often giving an overview of how the *thing* works (if needed). In many times, there is a personal insight (or more) as an addendum.

What I am trying to push with `git`, the `readme.md` file and services like github, is a sort of new subjectivisation realised thanks to the act of publishing a project in a public website and presenting it through the `readme.md` file: a repository with a one-liner in the readme.md is at best a bad introduction (or a temporary one), at worst a non-existent object in the discourse of, for example, github.

In the same way, it’s almost possible to see this `readme.md` file as a small personal manifest of intentions: I did this and this because I was unhappy or very excited about that and that, so I came up with this bunch of code.
