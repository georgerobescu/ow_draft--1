# ow—draft #1, notes

*Some notes and an attempt to outline the **draft #1** of the project*

* git
* readme.md
* self-realisation
* self-discipline
* subjectivisation
* ethics
* collectivity
* distribution

The first draft of the project consists in the writing of a `readme.md` file, a very common piece of information almost always present inside the folder repository of a code-based project.

`git` is a system that helps to keep track of every change made inside a selected folder: in this way a programmer can have a more granular control of what has been implemented, patched, deleted and so on, to the point of spotting differences at the level of single characters.

This mechanism transforms the person using it in a sort of log-keeper, putting her/him in a position in which for the benefit of future reviews, every actions she/he makes is traced.

Hence, the `readme.md` file acts as the point-of-entrance to someone’s project. In it, it is usually delineated the objectives of the repository, how it has been implemented (citing other projects which have been made use of), and often giving an overview of how the *thing* works (if needed). In many times, there is a personal insight, or more, as an addendum.

What I am trying to push with `git`, the `readme.md` file and services like github, is a sort of new subjectivisation realised thanks to the act of publishing a project in a public website and presenting it through the `readme.md` file. You do exist because you are able to present your project; your project does exist because it has been presented by you. The two elements, creator and artefact, find their space in the general discourse of a site like github through the `readme.md` file.

This brings to some scenarios:
* *one-liner* readme.md→the project is in a temporary phase at best, non-existent at worst.
* ???

In the same way, it’s almost possible to see this `readme.md` file as a small personal manifest of intentions, every time re-perpetuated with different content: *I did this and this because I was unhappy or very excited about that and that, so I came up with this bunch of code*.

In order not to lose myself in one of the many themes that I’m trying to connect together, I want to focus solely on the readme.md file itself: it will be used as the common canvas on which mentioning other questions and problematics, without losing the conversation in too many details about new themes that might be born out of the general discourse.

I’ll try to stick to it also because I want to expand its boundaries as much as possibile, with the use of analogies and personal hypothesis, even if haphazard ones (read *bullshit*).

On a different general level, a website like github represents a new way to show the performativy of a project, and to extension, of the person (or people) behind it.

In a sense, it’s a multifaceted tool to help someone working better (and supposedly more efficiently and with less problems in fixing possible bugs coming up along the way), but at the same time, in keeping track of every action and in asking to the person working on it to externalise what has been done—hypothetically—after each new edit, `git` establishes a form of discipline. I’d called it *self-discipline*, and it works very well with the process of subjectivisation that the act of publishing a project on a code-sharing platform like github ignites.

To each new commit indeed, corresponds a `timestamp` of the moment in which that action was performed. And whenever you decide is time to push all those edits inside a new `commit`, you are forced to described what you just did in a way that, ideally, summarises quite well the new changes.

Another aspect the project wants to touch is the inherently question of transparency. Originally what I wanted to do, was to presente a series of ascii art pieces, rich enough to fit the 2500 words requested for the thesis proposal. This brought me to the idea of the .nfo file and the readme file respectively. From there, I began to think that maybe there were more potentials in exploring the format of the readme file: from the easy parallel to an artistic manifesto, to the personal declaration of each worker uploading her/his project on a code-sharing website.

The idea of digging into the torrentz culture is still appealing to me, but less for the ascii art part and more on the p2p side and the building of a different form of trust between people (users?). To be a bit more exact, I’m still excited about the idea that the second guest-tutor pitched on me: a film which unfolds itself through the acquisition of more and more data from the different servers that the torrent app uses to build that film. A sort of genesis of the raw material needed to constitute the final product.

Back to transparency. Why using ascii art? Especially in an .nfo file, it is a way to externalise one’s own specificity and sense of being, meaning, how to be represented and seen in the world.
At the same time, ascii art can be utilised as a way to avoid or interspersing the usual work-time and work-related mindset with a subversion?, act of making fun of?, act of having fun?, personal expression?, perversion? of the usual schemes adopted in the work environment and so on. ascii art took importance and usage, since the beginning, to overcome several technical limitations (for example of the printer), to be used as a sign, a personal brand, in the p2p environment, and at the same time as a form of language to express *feelings* (emojis). These last two activities have in common a conception of informality and division between work and leisure in the digital labour context, which just overcome or don’t take into account the line between the two mindset. Since it’s probably a matter of different mindset, rather than primarily of context or activities.
Would you ever add a smiley at the end of a business email to enhance or shift the tone of the conversation to something more relaxed and informal? At the same time, how do you classify (read experience and see and ultimately conceive—or perceive?) the p2p activity? Is it work? It is a side passion, an hobby, an experiment part and infused of specific subcultures (warez, computer nerds, hackers, music and film lovers?) or rather, maybe, a practice started in a particular context but which then expanded to any possible place in which it would have been helpful to make use of it?

It’s strong on me the parallel between ascii art and tumblr, especially its NSFW label, which is used for specific content which may not be suitable in a working environment.

First, why would someone go to check her his tumblr or any tumblr while on the working environment? Sure. What’s the difference between this way of taking a break and go to smoke a cigarette or get up a have a short walk? So this already acknowledges a possible scenario very common when someone work with a computer at her his job and is used to check out tumblr during his leisure time.

This act of transforming the working environment in a private space—quite quite quite different than going for a pee or a glass of water or some sun or some fresh air—constitutes the common border with the ascii art and the act of irreverence present to both actions. It’s not the act of downloading a torrent or using a p2p tool of any kind, but rather the usage of some ascii art inside it (the .nfo file) to mix all these categories: work/leisure, private/public (I won’t dig into this dichotomy now), through an act of irreverence. Almost a joke?
It’s like an extra layer of worthiness inside something which may seen as a leisure time item (e.g. a downloaded film), on top of an act that it’s for sure dispassionate in its being for free. Who does know the exact reasons behind the distribution of copyrighted material for free? Could it be pure laziness as an effect of a specific way of thinking the internet? Or is it for not approving the act of paying, or the copyright model, or the free circulation of stuff on the internet (cfr. previous point)?

A good example is what was made by the now defunct design studio *Second Cousins* in the `.css` file of the websites they built: instead of simply adding their infos, so name, website, date of release and version of release, in pure warez-like fashion, Jake Dow-Smit added an illustration of a man with long hair singing and dancing under the rain, with annexed title of the studio.

It’s a so-called easter-egg, part of the programmer culture (one might say?), and exactly for this, it’s a dispersion of extra-added value for the people inspecting the website and looking up how the style of it was implemented. So, during a working-related activity (no matter if performed by a professional designer/developer or an amateur one or simply a curious person—but still the act of curiosity can been judged as wanting to know more, so probably still under the umbrella of work), there is an unexpected finding which can provoke pleasure or a smile or a release of some sort (included a *wtf man, you serious?*).

Reaching back again to the theme of transparency, what all this ascii art, .nfo file and readme.md file presuppose is, indeed, an element of research, of being curious towards such artefacts and wanting to find out more, to open up and dissect things.
It is, then, a movement quite at the opposite of an easily grilled-served transparency, because it needs a vector willing to zig-zag on the other side. Nonetheless all these things are there to be discovered, teared apart and studied.


Approaching transparency on the level of `git` and websites like github, what I find quite telling and deeply at work is the language in use throughout the two tools. Besides this, the history of the commits for each project and the logic behind it. But these two elements are quite self-evident, though the first one a bit more subtle.
