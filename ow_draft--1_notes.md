# ow—draft #1, notes

*Some notes and an attempt to outline the **draft #1** of the project*

* git
* readme.md
* self-realisation
* self-discipline
* subjectivisation
* ethics
* collectivity
* distribution

The first draft of the project consists in the writing of a `readme.md` file, a very common piece of information almost always present inside the folder repository of a code-based project.

`git` is a system that helps to keep track of every change made inside a selected folder: in this way a programmer can have a more granular control of what has been implemented, patched, deleted and so on, to the point of spotting differences at the level of single characters.

This mechanism transforms the person using it in a sort of log-keeper, putting her/him in a position in which for the benefit of future reviews, every actions she/he makes is traced.

Hence, the `readme.md` file acts as the point-of-entrance to someone’s project. In it, it is usually delineated the objectives of the repository, how it has been implemented (citing other projects which have been made use of), and often giving an overview of how the *thing* works (if needed). In many times, there is a personal insight (or more) as an addendum.

What I am trying to push with `git`, the `readme.md` file and services like github, is a sort of new subjectivisation realised thanks to the act of publishing a project in a public website and presenting it through the `readme.md` file. You do exist because you are able to present your project; your project does exist because it has been presented by you. The two elements, creator and artefact, find their space in the general discourse of a site like github through the `readme.md` file.

This brings to some scenarios:
* *one-liner* readme.md→the project is in a temporary phase at best, non-existent at worst.
* ???

In the same way, it’s almost possible to see this `readme.md` file as a small personal manifest of intentions, every time re-perpetuated with different content: *I did this and this because I was unhappy or very excited about that and that, so I came up with this bunch of code*.

In order not to lose myself in one of the many themes that I’m trying to connect together, I want to focus solely on the readme.md file itself: it will be used as the common canvas on which mentioning other questions and problematics, without losing the conversation in too many details about new themes that might be born out of the general discourse.

I’ll try to stick to it also because I want to expand its boundaries as much as possibile, with the use of analogies and personal hypothesis, even if haphazard ones (read *bullshit*).

On a different general level, a website like github represents a new way to show the performativy of a project, and to extension, of the person (or people) behind it.

In a sense, it’s a multifaceted tool to help someone working better (and supposedly more efficiently and with less problems in fixing possible bugs coming up along the way), but at the same time, in keeping track of every action and ask to the person working on it to externalise what has been done (hypothetically) after each new edit, `git` establishes a form of discipline. I’d called it *self-discipline*, and it works very well with the process of subjectivisation that the act of publishing a project on a code-sharing platform like github ignites.

To each new commit indeed, corresponds a timestamp of the moment in which that action was performed. And whenever you decide is time to push all those edits inside a new commit, you are forced to described what you just did in a way that, ideally, summarises quite well the new changes.

Another aspect of the project wants to touch the inherently question of transparency. Originally what I wanted to do, was to presente a series of ascii art pieces, rich enough to fit the 2500 words requested for the thesis proposal. This brought me to the idea of the .nfo file and the readme file respectively. From there, I began to think that maybe there were more potentials in exploring the format of the readme file: from the easy parallel to an artistic manifesto, to the personal declaration of each worker uploading her/his project on a code-sharing website.

The idea of digging into the torrentz culture is still appealing to me, but less for the ascii art part and more on the p2p side and the building of a different form of trust between people (users?). To be a bit more exact, I’m still excited on the idea that the second guest-tutor pitched on me: a film which unfolds itself through the acquisition of more and more data from the different servers that the torrent app uses to build the film. A sort of genesis of the raw material needed to constitute the final product.

Back to transparency.
