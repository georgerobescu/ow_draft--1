# ow—draft #1, notes

*Some notes and an attempt to outline the __draft #1__ of the project*.

* git
* readme.md
* self-realisation
* self-discipline
* subjectivisation
* ethics
* collectivity
* distribution

The first draft of the project consists in the writing of a `readme.md` file, a very common piece of information almost always present inside the folder repository of a code-based project.

`git` is a system that helps to keep track of every change made inside a selected folder: in this way a programmer can have a more granular control of what has been implemented, patched, deleted and so on, to the point of spotting differences at the level of single characters.

This mechanism transforms the person using it in a sort of log-keeper, putting her him in a position in which, for the benefit of future reviews, every actions she he makes is traced.

Hence, the `readme.md` file acts as the point-of-entrance to someone’s project. In it, are usually delineated the objectives of the repository, how it has been implemented (citing other projects which have been made use of), and often giving an overview of how the *thing* works (if needed). In many instances, there is a personal insight, or more than one, as an addendum.

What I am trying to push with `git`, the `readme.md` file and services like github, is a sort of new subjectivisation accomplished thanks to the act of publishing a project in a public website and presenting it through the `readme.md` file. You do exist because you are able to present your project; your project does exist because it has been presented by you. The two elements, creator and artefact, find their space in the general discourse of a site like github through the `readme.md` file.

This brings to some scenarios:
* *One-liner* `readme.md` file→the project is in a temporary phase at best, non-existent at worst.
* Fully technical `readme.md` files in which there is no mention of what the project is all about.
* Poorly implemented and structured `readme.md` files, with duplicated or confused content.

In the same way, it’s almost possible to see this `readme.md` file as a small personal manifest of intentions, every time re-perpetuated with different content: *I did this and this because I was unhappy or very excited about that and that, so I came up with this bunch of code*.

In order not to lose myself in one of the many themes that I’m trying to connect together, I want to focus solely on the `readme.md` file itself: it will be used as the common canvas on which mentioning other questions and problematics, without losing the conversation in too many details about new subjects that might be born out of the general discourse.

I’ll try to stick to it also because I want to expand its boundaries as much as possibile, with the use of analogies and personal hypothesis, even if haphazard ones (read *bullshit*).

On a different general level, a website like github represents a new way to show the performativity of a project, and for extension, of the person (or people) behind it.

In a sense, it’s a multifaceted tool to help someone working better (and supposedly more efficiently and with less problems in fixing possible bugs coming up along the way), but at the same time, in keeping track of every action and in asking to the person working on it to externalise what has been done—hypothetically—after each new edit, `git` establishes a form of discipline. I’d called it *self-discipline*, and it works very well with the process of subjectivisation that the act of publishing a project on a code-sharing platform like github ignites.

To each new `commit` indeed, corresponds a `timestamp` of the moment in which that action was performed. And whenever you decide is time to `push` all those edits inside a new `commit`, you are forced to described what you just did in a way that, ideally, summarises quite well the new changes.

Another aspect the project wants to touch is the inherently question of transparency. Originally what I wanted to do, was to present a series of ascii art pieces, rich enough to fit the 2500 words requested for the thesis proposal. This brought me to the idea of the `.nfo` file and the `readme.md` file respectively. From there, I began to think that maybe there were more potentials in exploring the format of the `readme.md` file: from the easy parallel to an artistic manifesto, to the personal declarations of each worker uploading her his project on a code-sharing website.

The idea of digging into the torrentz culture is still appealing to me, but less for the ascii art part and more on the p2p side and the building of a different form of trust between people (users?). To be a bit more exact, I’m still excited about the idea that the second guest-tutor pitched me: a film which unfolds itself through the acquisition of more and more data from the different servers that the torrent app uses to build that film. A sort of genesis of the raw material needed to constitute the final product.

Back to transparency. Why using ascii art? Especially in an `.nfo` file, it is a way to externalise one’s own specificity and sense of being, meaning, how to be represented and seen in the world.
At the same time, ascii art can be utilised as a way to avoid or interspersing the usual work-time and work-related mindset with a subversion?, act of making fun of?, act of having fun?, personal expression?, perversion? of the usual schemes adopted in the work environment and so on. Ascii art took importance and usage, since the beginning, to overcome several technical limitations (for example in the 60s printers connected to computers lacked in extended graphical abilities); to be used as a sign, a personal brand, in the p2p environment; and at the same time as a form of language to express *feelings* (emojis). These last two activities have in common a conception of informality and division between work and leisure in the digital labour context, which just overcome or don’t take into account the line between the two mindsets. Since it’s probably a matter of different mindsets, rather than primarily of context or activities.

Would you ever add a smiley at the end of a business email to enhance or shift the tone of the conversation to something more relaxed and informal? At the same time, how do you classify (read experience and see and ultimately conceive—or perceive?) the p2p activity? Is it work? Is it a side passion, a hobby, an experiment part and infused of specific subcultures (warez, computer nerds, hackers, music and film lovers)? Or rather, maybe, a practice started in a particular context but which then expanded to any possible place in which it would have been helpful to make use of?

* * *

It’s strong on me the parallel between ascii art and tumblr, especially its NSFW label, which is used for specific content which may not be suitable in a working environment.

First, why would someone go checking her his tumblr or any tumblr while on a working environment? Sure. What’s the difference between this way of taking a break and going to smoke a cigarette or get up and have a short walk? So, this already acknowledges a possible scenario very common when someone works with a computer at her his job and he she is used to check out tumblr during his her leisure time.

Second, the act of transforming the working environment in a private space—quite quite quite different than going for a pee or a glass of water or some sun or some fresh air—constitutes the common border with the ascii art and the act of irreverence present in both actions. It’s not the act of downloading a torrent or using a p2p tool of any kind, but rather the usage of some ascii art inside it (the `.nfo` file) to mix all these categories: work/leisure, private/public, through an act of irreverence. Almost a joke?
It’s like an extra layer of worthiness inside something which may be seen as a leisure time item (e.g. a downloaded film), on top of an act that it’s for sure dispassionate in its being for free. Who does know the exact reasons behind the distribution of copyrighted material for free? Could it be pure laziness as an effect of a specific way of thinking the internet? Or is it a clear statement of not approval on the act of paying, or on the copyright model, or on the free circulation of stuff on the internet (cfr. first point)?

A good example is what was made by the now defunct design studio *[Second Cousins](http://secondcousins.org)* in the `style.css` file of the websites they built: instead of simply adding their infos (so name, website, date of release and release version number), in pure warez-like fashion, they added an illustration of a man with long hair singing and dancing under the rain, with annexed title of the studio.

Have a look — [http://andrewgooch.com/wp-content/themes/theme-v01/style.css](http://andrewgooch.com/wp-content/themes/theme-v01/style.css).

It’s a so-called easter-egg, part of the programmer culture (one might say?), and exactly for this, it’s a dispersion of extra-added value for the people inspecting the website and looking up for how the style of it was implemented. So, during a working-related activity (no matter if performed by a professional designer/developer or an amateur one or simply a curious person—but still the act of curiosity can been judged as wanting to know more, so probably still under the umbrella of work), there is an unexpected finding which can provoke pleasure or a smile or an emotional release of some sort (included a *wtf man, you serious?*).

Reaching back again to the theme of transparency, what all this ascii art, `.nfo` file and `readme.md` file presuppose is, indeed, an element of research, of being curious towards such artefacts and wanting to find out more, to open up and dissect things. It is, then, a movement quite at the opposite spectrum of an easily grilled-served transparency, because it needs a vector willing to zig-zag on the other side. Nonetheless all these things are there to be discovered, teared apart and enjoyed.

Approaching transparency on the level of `git` and websites like github, instead, what I find there quite telling and deeply at work is the language in use throughout the two tools:
* forking
* pulling
* pushing
* committing

to name a few of the basic operations possible to perform.
I love the brutality of the verbs chosen, which are a reminder of physical actions you would do on machines, maybe? It’s also possible to see in it a direct correlation with the culture within they are born, white-male computer-educated people. And I cannot avoid to mention this project in which sexual connotations are exploited to just have fun—in the perfect style of the bro culture (cfr. *[brogrammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brogrammer)*).

— [DICSS](https://github.com/letsgetrandy/DICSS) and especially the opened [issues](https://github.com/letsgetrandy/DICSS/issues), where most of the posts are other supposedly invented and non-existent programming languages named just to expand the conversation about sexuality.

More than the ethical (simply moral?) problematics about the subject, which are part of an ever-more rising culture of “cool dudes writing code” (cfr. brogrammer), what’s really interesting for the subject I’m exploring now is the usage of the `readme.md` file structure and successively the `issues` functions as a mechanism to build a narrative, a fiction. Not focusing on the fact that the library in itself is a bluff (though it might work, that’s not the interesting part), rather building momentum on the surrounding environment painted ad-hoc all around it (see supporting narrative) and on the act itself of making a sexist joke. And then knowing that probably a good majority of users will give you a high-five for this and successively will have a big laugh with their own mates.

This is a very active element that can be used to build the culture inside a specific *peer-production* environment.

Then, there is the history of the `commits` for each project and the logic behind it. It can at first be connected to the theme of transparency, an obsessive and modernist idea of order, building history and retrieving informations. This for sure helps in the making of the project: something is not working anymore, just go and check out the history page on github and spot what you changed—one click and it will bring you back to that position. Good to go again.

The creepiness in this `commit history` is not the fact of being able to read at once what has been done by the different people involved in the project, rather how this mechanism imprints itself in the mindset of the people adopting it.

I love it, to be honest. The idea of tracking your process down to each particular choice and change is quite phenomenal. It is much more if you do your work using text, since you can track it down to the single character. But what about this massive accumulation of `commit histories` from all over the world into [github.com](https://github.com)? I cannot yet define it really well, but the fact of contributing with your own shit, self-voluntarily and often time quite excitingly, to one gigantic buck of information it’s sometimes discomforting. It plays very well with the need of order, easily retrievability and sharing of data, often times looked after by many people. A system like this keeps the situation under control, starting from your own reality. You know you can efficiently (but still with crazy projects) contribute your part to the community you (want to) belong to. 

All this it’s instilling a habit of self-quantification and a propensity to easily give explanations (on command) of everything someone is doing, in a sort of just-in-case attitude. And this reinforces an idea of perfectly disciplined worker. Such perfectly disciplined individual is extremely transparent: first of all to himself, then to the big mother who gives him access to the service; he’s self-regulating and efficient; finally, he’s in the reality of the world through his work—how many `commits` have been pushed to the server and how funny and concise are his `readme.md` files? How many times will his projects be `forked`?

Maintenance work is what `git` is all about. Therefore, here lie my interests in exploring it and push it in all kind of directions until some other things become visibile, such as:
* A portrait of the worker (user?) (ethics, transparency, subjectivisation, etc.).
* An analysis of the way collaboration, exchange, and in general peer-production (including making friends) is performed on a platform which uses git.
* An exploitation of such tools.

My interest in the maintenance work domain began with the new acknowledged role of the woman as an housewife during the 70s. This brought to a redefinition of the woman as a natural subject (at the time and still now, woman→someone who takes care of the house and of the children as a natural activity and not as a form of mixed labours).

In that same period a new shift in the economic paradigm happened, with the rising of the cognitive worker (producer and distiller of informations) and a passage from Fordism to Post-Fordism as a production model, at least in many countries of the Western world.

Nowadays, the life of a developer is comprised of prototyping session, production code session, reviews and discussion about it, stitched together by an overall layer of maintenance of all these artefacts in an intelligible and coherent form. There are for sure teams in which big projects are split down into smaller chunks, but still, these tasks are accomplished by each component of that same team.

Hence, how did the internet replicate and transform the aspect of the maintenance work to such levels of representation, see the `readme.md` file? What are the political potentialities of such a low-profile artefact in the (re)definition of this kind of worker?

## Brief considerations about how to present the artwork for the Year-End exhibition at the atelier

In thinking about how to display the first example of the Thesis Research, I came across a doubt: would it be better to also show the original text in the written form, beside to the audio tracks (which translates this text to a sound form)?

I feel it is necessary, since it gives the ground to show how things are moving: the text is no less important than the later translation of it in an audio form. This last one, though being more appealing probably, more effective in expressing the situation (cfr. set, stage), where I see this work being placed, or for whom, or within which context and discourse, hides nonetheless the (raw? boring?) nature of the tools that I want to inquiry. Hence, let’s show the text in its visual-textual form.

Here comes a new crossroads: should I print it out or should I display it through the website (the github project I created)? In the latter scenario the thing stays even more natural, in its place (I don’t know why and in which way I am using the adjective natural here, but it feels okay–appropriate to use it). In the former case, instead, the text would pass through a new transformation to a paper office-document or booklet-like format.

An element to keep in mind, which I would like it to be just a minor one (and maybe it is), but it might be quite relevant, is that I’m gonna most probably use my laptop to display the artwork: the soundcloud page where I uploaded the playlist and the github project where you can read the text. The only problem that I see in this is that the exhibition lasts two weeks, and I just have one laptop (which I need, tbc). But apparently after the opening the exhibition will work through “on-appointment” visits. So this might facilitate a lot the things.

Said this, if I would be inclined to print out the `readme.md` text on paper, the artwork would immediately change to something else. Not completely different, but it would become a set of instructions/documentation. Which is not really the case, because the text is a mix between a manifesto and self-help tips on how to use the git and github.com technologies. The manifesto part is more contemplative and at times absurd or weird on the tool itself, opening the discourse to other kind of implications besides the technical knowledge of, for example, how to make a `pull request`.

And my fear, or my not being really convinced about printing the text out, is that it might be just an easy way for the visitors to understand that there is a text and some audio tracks, as clear and distinctive objects. I want to emphasise that I don’t think this would make more accessibile the artwork itself, but just on a level of objects, of materials of which the artwork is composed of, the booklet or paper form has, at first sight—probably?—a higher connection to the idea that there is a text, its indexical value is higher than a webpage in a browser.

Again, if I am concern about a contextualisation of the artwork, and I am, I would just place a laptop with these two pages open in two browser windows. I would put the computer on one of the white tables that we have in the studio together with a glass of water (possible workspace for a software developer?).

Of course I am fascinated by the idea of printing out the `readme.md` text in a booklet format in which every edit of the text finds space in the book. But what for? To show the process? In that case it would be probably more interesting to print on the same page, overlapping, the same text but in different version (moments of the draft) using two colours: one for the final version and one for the wip versions. But I am not sure I want to draw attention to that, since it’s going to take away importance to the sound piece.

Okay, so now the hypothesis of showing both artworks as interdependent but standing on their own. Still, thinking why printing out the `readme.md` text, besides for the apparent accessibility reason, to me it still looks so out of place that text on a piece of paper. But for sure it is more easily readable.

I don’t really like, to certain extents, the attitude of printing out the internet, of printing the web and its databases or portion of texts as an aesthetic act which dies right there, often times. I like that it dies just there, what I found sometimes lazy is printing out something from the internet just because, and make it seems interesting just because of the aesthetic and performative act itself. Considering this, I’m not sure of this performative act onto paper, I am way more interested in the performative possibilities of the webpage, at this point.

Yesterday, talking about all this with Alberto, he said showing also the text and not just the audio tracks, it’s a way to scan the same “document” in a different way, which is not, or less, linear, as it happen with sound. The text is indeed divide into sections, and in the index of the readme.md file on github.com, every section is linked to the relative § (hello #local-scroll).

This jumping to different portions of the text is probably more easily and physically possible to do with a booklet. You browse it and voilà! random page.

(*pause*)

I realised what was not working with keeping two browser windows one next to the other: each window has to have its own visual space. Therefore, I’ll put them fullscreen. I was deciding if it was better to just put them in two separated tabs and using one window. But then I realised there’s apparently no way to repeat a playlist in soundcloud (have to check better). And maybe, this is a good thing, I might just use iTunes and then hide everything on the desktop if someone swipes left or right and goes away from the fullscreen browser window (with the `readme.md` page).

In this way, still, I wonder if I am not putting the sound element on a lower level than the text element. That’s the tricky part of living in a very obsessed visual-driven culture. That’s way having to tabs in the browser window would be the a nice approach. You visually see there are two pages you can check. You see one is a soundcloud page, which if you know makes you do a connection, if not, you’re going to check it out?
The only way to play the same playlist on and on is through the shuffle option, it seems. I’m not sure I want to break the linearity of the audio-text, in this case.

I tried the browser window+iTunes setup, both windows side to side (non-fullscreen mode), and it’s quite confusing: not in sense of how to interact with things, but at the level of why are you showing it this way.

Indeed, I am now more convinced that having a one-fullscreen browser window with two open tabs is the best way. The visitor can move between the two website and if the soundcloud playlist stops (since there’s no repeat option in the website), he she can just click on the big play button again (I feel so stupid about it, thinking of having to setup an on-repeat option at all cost and not giving trust to the visitor).

The two tabs work as iterations of the same source-text, you move back and forth with different (internal) times.
