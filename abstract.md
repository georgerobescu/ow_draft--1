6 audio tracks converted from a text file through text-to-speech technology

As digital labour is advancing and self-tracking technologies are becoming integral and almost tedious tasks of such jobs, how are they affecting workers? How do they (de-)inform them?

*ow_draft--1* is a text part manifesto and part self-help tips, which gives a sketch of the git and github.com technologies. git is a version-control system: you set it up inside a folder and it keeps track of every change you make to the files inside it. The text is reversed to a podcast-like audio format to be more aligned and appealing within the software developer culture.
