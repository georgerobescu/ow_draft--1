text file, 6 audio tracks converted from the text file through text-to-speech technology

As digital labour is advancing and self-tracking technologies are becoming integral and almost tedious tasks of, for example, a programmer’s job—how are they affecting workers? How do they (de-)inform them?

*ow_draft--1* is a text, part manifesto and part self-help tips, which gives a sketch of git and github.com technologies. git is a version-control system which keeps track of every change made to a file.

The project focuses on the (political) potentialities of the documentation-text present in each git-based project: which kinds of ethics circulate in these spaces?
