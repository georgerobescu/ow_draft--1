# ow—draft #1

*Is there a reason why I am here, pushing keystrokes and committing my changes to the server, to the git-master of this project?*

## 1. Ethics

Create a new `readme.md` file in which you outline the intentions and objectives of the repository:
* What’s the aim of the project? Are you forking someone else project—thus supposedly improving it—or did you create a fresh new repo?
* How do you expect to use this code? 
* Why are you sharing it over on github? Is there a desire of being part of the/a community or is it simply a backup plan? Or, rather, is it just that you connect using the git version control system to github so strongly that you think it’s not possible to use solely git on your local machine?

For now, adding a simple description (one-liner!) of the repository is enough. Over time, and especially when you will push the final commit to at least reach the version 1.0 of the project, you’ll have (a) enough material, (b) hopefully a clearer idea of its purposes and (c) a bit more time to invest in the explanation and/or documentation of the repository.

This first step of creating and taking care of the `readme.md` file brings with itself different implications:
* for whom am I working and why do I want to document all this?
* who’s watching me doing this? is it for this reason that I am doing it?
* do I have and/or do I expect an audience?

Depending on the personal reality of each of us, we’ll reply to the above questions in a particular way. There after, some other points might be:
* am I part of a community?
* do I feel the obligation to share, improve and take part in a general (and particular) discourse or in many? (for e.g. forking cool projects that I like in order to improve them and spread them in my circles; feeling the right to take as much free code as possible and use it in my own retributed projects, since it has been put out there and nobody will ever know).
* what are the dynamics of these communities and more specifically of these artefacts, tools, and means of productions?

These last questions are basic lines that constitutes what it means to be part of an open-source software-based community, or satellites and posthumous positions born after (Creative Commons, for example).

This first area dives into the realm of the *ethics*: from the moment you delineate your first words into the readme file, you assume a particular position and therefore contribute to the place where you published such mentioned repository in a specific manner. Outlining the `readme.md` file is the first act to enter the discussion in which other contributors are taking part. This place of discussion is the working place, also when the kind of projects submitted and shared to a website like github.com are made during one’s own free time. The `readme.md` file, hence, becomes the first form of identity able to mediate your work with the interest of other people hanging out in a working environment (github.com).


## 2. Participation

The `readme.md` file is a personal statement about the work that you’re doing, and it positions itself inside a broader space of actions (e.g. the politics of a community).

Depending on your own interests and needs, it might be that you’re working on a personal project just on your own or, on the other side, you are collaborating on someone else’s project—which at this point might be considered solely initiated by this someone else, but since the many contributions by different other enthusiast people, not anymore his *own thing*; it depends.

This passage marks a move from a personal space of action and connected morality, to a broader stage in which ethics have their own importance: you publish your repository somewhere over the internet and you are willing to, also thanks to the system implemented in the website where you upload your work, let people inspect your project and taking part in it, if they wish so.

The value of the `readme.md` file lies exactly in this: it welcomes others to a possibile conversation. The `readme.md` file is a subjective effort in making readable and understandable what you did or what you just started doing.

*Language+++*

# 3. Peer production

`git` is a system that works as an invisibile set of files inside the folder which you decide to use as your project repository.
What it does is to keep track of every change you implement to the files living in that folder: it’s like an invisible layer of pre-punched holes in your timecard. In fact, it’s you the one who decides when to really mark a change, or a series of changes, to the project: what you did, then, is a `commit` to the repository.

In this sense, usually the first file that you create and then commit to the repository is the `readme.md` file—it’s not necessary but it usually helps you to at least give a brief description of what’s going on in that repo.

Whenever you make changes to your project, it’s good practice to commit those edits to git (and often consequently to github), in order to have a log of what has been done up until that point.

This process was initially born for collaboratively purposes (to avoid miscommunication and mistakes between several people working remotely), but it has been adopted also as a way to document one’s own personal working process.

> I’m doing this, done, commit; I’m doing this, done, commit; *rhythm*

*How can you help to contribute on someone else’s project?*

1. Make sure you are logged in on one of the many services which let share git-repositories online (e.g. github, bitbucket).
2. Find a repository which you like.
3. Click on the `fork` button; in this way a copy (duplicate) of the repository will be created inside your own profile and you can immediately start to work on it (the content of the repository has been `pulled` down to your own git profile).
4. When you are done with the changes, just `push` it back to the master repository (the original source from which you `forked` it) and ask for a `pull to request` session. Other people (*users?*) involved in the repository (from the original creator of the repository to other contributors who forked the project as well) will receive a notifications.

It’s then a matter of discussing those changes in the issues section of the repository. Exactly here, peers dynamics take place.

Peer production between disparate users happens, instead, in the `pull request` section. After having submitted a new feature to the main project you’re contributing, whistle to the project manager you’d like to discuss something you made: a back and forth collaboration between the two parts will start (and ideally more people can enter the discussion).

Some people use the `pull request` feature to send themselves things to review:
1. open a new pull request at the end of the day before going to bed;
2. wake up the day after early in the morning, and while checking your email, read the notification you sent to yourself 8-10 hours before;
3. go back to work and complete the request.

A technique like this, let someone almost completely abstract her himself from the reality of working alone on a project, gaining a rather new magic level of interaction between two temporal-based version of oneself.

Conversely, the same feature can be intensely used to debate if there’s still one original creator of the project: what happen when the contributors take more and more voice in the discourse of it? How does the original creator feel like, especially when he she moved to the position of project manager? Does she he feel like an Art Director or a janitor? Since she he’s still in charge of deciding which pull requests to accept and to merge to the master project and which not, but at the same time has to possibly manage a mountain of pull requests because the project got quite some popularity, where does he she position him herself?

It is maybe here that the `readme.md` file becomes once again valuable in expressing a clear position on the project.

## 4. Transparency

In designing a better system to remotely collaborate on code-based project, git for sure emphasises on asking for clarity and preciseness on the side of the user.
“Add a comment to your commit” might seem still too friendly, meaning an open-ended question, which could turn into a field of experimental poetry or lazy vagueness.
But that commit goes up on your commit history and will stay there forever, unless you’re gonna delete the whole repository.

So how does one deal with? Are there any specific writing style, at least suggested ones, to better comply with the tracking system?

Some questions:
* Is it better to capitalise the first letter of the first word of the sentence or not?
* Do you use present tense or past tense (“fix a typo” or “Fixed a typo”)?

Both simple points are mostly a matter of the people you are working with in a specific repository, or, even better, just up to you if the project is one of your personal ones. Then, anyway, deciding upon a specific style will enhance your way of working. How would you react in reading, after a couple of days, that you “Fixed a typo” and now there is still a bug due to that edit? Would it not be better if, instead, you would have opted for the “fix a typo”, for the here and now? In doing so, all the future problems might be seen as still in the realm of possibilities, since the present tense gives a feeling of an active ongoing project, not of an action done and archived in the past.

As you’re building a micro public space, what’s your policy on the element of discoverability and surprise? Though ornamenting a readme file on github with some ascii art is not a smart choice, probably, since it’s the first text you see when you open the project page, other techniques such disseminating some of your other working file with small ascii art drawings (such as the `style.css` file), might result in an act of pleasure for the ones stumbling on them.
