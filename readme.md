# ow—draft #1

*Is there a reason for why I am here, pushing keystrokes and committing my changes to the server, to the git-master of this project?*

1. Create a new **readme.md** file in which you outline the intentions and objectives of the repository:
* What’s the aim of the project? Are you forking someone else project—thus supposedly improving it—or did you create a fresh new repo?
* How do you expect to use this code? 
* Why are you sharing it over on github? Is there a desire of being part of the/a community or is it simply a backup plan? Or, rather, is it just that you connect using the git version control system to github so strongly that you think it’s not possible to use solely git on your local machine?

For now, adding a simple description (one-liner!) of the repository is enough. Over time, and especially when you will push the final commit to at least reach the version 1.0 of the project, you’ll have (a) enough material, (b) hopefully a clearer idea of its purposes and (c) a bit more time to invest in the explanation and/or documentation of the repository.

This first step of creating and taking care of the readme.md file brings with itself different implications:
* for whom am I working and why do I want to document all this?
* who’s watching me doing this? is it for this reason that I am doing it?
* do I have and/or expect an audience?

Depending on the personal reality of each of us, we’ll reply to the above questions in a particular way. There after, some other points might be:
* am I part of a community?
* do I feel the obligation to share, improve and take part in a general (and particular) discourse or in many? (for e.g. forking cool projects that I like in order to improve them and spread them in my circles; feel the right to take as much free code as possible and use it in my own retributed projects, since it has been put out there and nobody will ever know).
* what are the dynamics of these communities and more specifically of these artefacts, tools, and means of productions?

The last questions are basic lines that constitutes what it means to be part of a GNU/Free Linux community or satellites and posthumous positions born after (Creative Commons, for example).

This first area dives into the realm of the *ethics*: from the moment you delineates your first words into the readme file, you assume a particular position and therefore contribute to the place where you published such mentioned repository in a specific manner.
